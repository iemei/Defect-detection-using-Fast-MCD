# 🔍 Semiconductor Defect Detection using FAST-MCD 

This project implements **automated defect detection** in semiconductor inspection images using a combination of:
- **FAST-MCD (Fast Minimum Covariance Determinant)** for robust statistical outlier detection,
- **Image structure classification** (linear, flat, patterned), and
- **Morphological post-processing**


It reproduces and extends the approach described in  
> **"Defect Inspection in Semiconductor Images Using FAST-MCD Method and Neural Network"**  
> *Lee, Kim et al., IEEE Access 2020.*
